    Swift coalsecence of binary SMBH in cosmological mergers. A zoom in simulation is performed
    using GASOLINE code. Here a couple of merging galaxies are taken from a Cosmological simulation
    of the project ARGO. The ratio of the background particles (the most massive) and the BHs is 
    approximately 1:100, so dynamical friction is well accounted for within the numerical integration.
    Once the binary is hardened and DF becomes inefficient, the central region of the remnant is 
    further integrated using N-body direct sum, where three bodies processes are dominant. Finally,
    at the scale of a few parsecs and below, post newtonian terms are included in order to account
    for gravitational wave emissions. The conclusions are that the inclusion of PN terms shorten the
    decay time significantly compared with previous works here mergers of isolated galaxies have been
    studied. **As a future reference, it would be interesting to reproduce the results of these paper
    using our semianalytical approach.**
