abstract ={We describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation and black hole (BH) accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained representations of the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and BH accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation pressurizes highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state (EOS). We show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive BHs in galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of accreting BHs to the surrounding gas, we show how this feedback regulates the growth of BHs. In gas-rich mergers of galaxies, we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity when the tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an accreting supermassive BH has grown to a critical size, feedback terminates its further growth and expels gas from the central region in a powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore able to address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation and BH accretion during the formation of galaxies.},
