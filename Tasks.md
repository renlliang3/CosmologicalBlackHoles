#Tasks


1. Compile other methods for treating dynamical friction in simulations. (Test them?)

2. Understand and write an own example of a non-linear least squared fitting for the potential.

3. Study Arepo in a structured way. Understanding the basics of its functioning.

4. Run isolated simulations of dark matter and test friction treatments for different resolutions. (Tunning to obtain robust resoluts with the resolution).

5. Run more realistic simulations of isolated galaxies with gas and mergers of galaxies. Test DF approach with high resolution runs.

6. Run a cosmological simulation with the improved DF treatment.

7. Run zoom-in simulations from the previous cosmological simulations with high resolution and compare if the obtained results keep valid.
